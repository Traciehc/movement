making sure i can creat a repo
clone repo to local
add files, and make changes locally.
go back to repo in origin and (also) make changes
go back to local and do a fetch of origin repo
commit local changes and push back to origin
go to origin and pull in changes
ive added files to the local repo but have not commited yet
i am now making changes to the origin and commiting changes for the edit of the 
read me file.
